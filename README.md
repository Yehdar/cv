# Portfolio Website

Got the opportunity to finally use ViteJS on a project. Basically, ViteJS provides immediate feedback on changes during a live session. For example, without it, you would have to refresh the webpage each time to see the new changes. Anyways, I used react and tailwindcss. Note, this is only a frontend website with no backend whatsover.

## Future Reminders

Remember to `npm run dev` to start the app on a localhost
